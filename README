I have first hooked the computing next board functionality with a new next command to read in a board and print out the result.
Then I have implemented a random game with RandomPlayer.I then created a MinimaxPlayer and an MinimaxAlphaBetaPlayer.
MinimaxAlphaBetaPlayer uses alpha beta pruning in conjunction with minimax to play the game.

To find the timing in real time for each of the player, MinimaxPlayer and MinimaxAlphaBetaPlayer, 
please put time infront of their commandline commands to run them. 

For example, 

1) for minimax, please type: 

	time sh run.sh minimax

2) for alphabeta, please type: 
	time sh run.sh alphabeta


From my testing of both of the codes, I have seen a significant difference between the timing of minimax and alphabeta.

Some of my test datas as follow:
1) Test 1:
	minimax: real    0m6.034s
	alphabeta: real    0m0.135s
2) Test 2:
	minimax: real    0m6.195s
	alphabeta: real    0m0.061s
3) Test 3:
	minimax: real    0m5.689s
	alphabeta: real    0m0.052s
4) Test 4:
	minimax: real    0m5.652s
	alphabeta: real    0m0.060s
